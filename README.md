# Image Classification Model

### Overview
A powerful deep learning model for classifying images into predefined categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
This repository contains an implementation of an **Image Classification Model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy. CNNs are widely used in image recognition tasks, where they help extract important features from the images for classification.

### Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment images to ensure robust training.
- **CNN Architecture**: The model consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification.
- **Training & Validation**: Monitor performance with real-time accuracy and loss metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pythonophile/image-classification-model.git
   cd image-classification-model
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```

## Data
To train the model, you need a dataset of labeled images. You can either:
- Use your own dataset, organized into subfolders for each class.
- Download a dataset from popular sources like **Kaggle**, or **TensorFlow Datasets**.

Place the dataset into the `data/` directory, with separate subdirectories for `train`, `validation`, and `test`.

---

## Model Architecture
The model leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling for feature extraction.
- Dense layers with dropout for classification.
- **Softmax** activation on the output layer to predict probabilities for each class.

You can find the model definition in `src/model.py`.

---

## Training the Model
1. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

2. You can also experiment using the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` for more interactive exploration.

---

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model on the test dataset:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```
This script outputs:
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision, recall, F1-score

## Results
Once trained, the model achieves the following metrics (replace with your results):

- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 90%
- **Recall**: 88%

Check the `results/` directory for visualizations of the model's performance on sample images.
